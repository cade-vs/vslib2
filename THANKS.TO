  I'd like to thank the following people for helping me for vslib:

  - Ivo Baylov <ivo@datamax.bg> for the KMP search hint.

  - Larry Wall <larry@wall.org> for Perl. :)
    (most work done on this library is about the Perl-like structures)

  - Philip Hazel <ph10@cam.ac.uk> and University of Cambridge for
    the fantastic pcre library!

  - Arno Schaefer for (still perfectly working getopt) :)
